# Temperature-prediction

## Introduction:
Following repository contains code used to compare diffrent regressors in solving problem of predicting maximal tempoerature during the day based on various weather data.  

## Tested regressors:
- linear regression
- decission tree
- random forest regressor
- voting regressor
- bagging regressor 
- Gradient boosting regressor
